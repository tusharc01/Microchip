# **Engineer II – Device Modeling**

## **Job Description**

* In depth knowledge of electrical engineering fundamentals including deep sub-micron CMOS device operation and characteristics, understanding of advancing modeling techniques
* Hands on experience with simulation using tools such as HSPICE, Finesim/PrimeSim or Spectre
* Understand any digital/mixed signal block such as SRAM, I/O using specification
* Define timing arcs like setup, hold, propagation delay
* Extract netlist through StarRCXT
* Ability to write SPICE test bench (compatible to simulators like HSpice, FineSim, Spectre etc) for any digital block from the scratch.
* Write measurement statements to get required timing and power data
* Run simulations using SPICE simulator
* Expertise in Perl, Shell, TCL scripting

### **Secondary Skill Set**

* Hands on experience with running PrimeTime, Tempus extracting timing data for custom PnR blocks
* Understand any custom ASIC blocks like Processor by reading spec
* Define timing arcs like setup, hold, propagation delay
* Extract SPEF netlist through StarRCXT
* Define set case analysis statements to configure block in required modes
* Back annotate SPEF and extract all the required timing data

## **Requirements/Qualifications**
