Total Questions- 60 [(Apti, Digital, Verilog, and C Programming and DVLSI]

### Round 1 (F2F Interview)(Physical Design) - 45 min

- Starting with my intro. Based on that i was asked me What im currently doing in my project. So i told him About ASIC Design Flow that currently i'm working on. And Learning physical design to get better understanding on that.

- I explained him the ASIC Design flow properly, That till what step i have done and What is still remaining. Then he started asking in depth about my project.
  
- He asked me the Difference between Post Synthesis STA and Post-Layout STA. I answered that. And Also asked one ques that What should be done to avoid the Post-Layout STA voilation which may not come in Post-synthesis STA. I also answered the reason for that and given one suggestion to avoid that.

- Then he came in Fundamentals of STA. What do i understand by Setup and Hold time. I was explained to draw on Paper with proper definition also (with proper Two FF case and waveform)

- Then he came to buffers present in `.lib` file. What are they? Why are they used for? Then started doing analysis on different sized buffers.

- He asked me that what are the difference between Buffers having small size and ones having bigger size? I first answered him that sorry sir, i haven't analyzed on buffers present in Standard lib. But he insisted me to just think about it.

- He given me the hints that Let's suppose two metal wires having one small and one longer starting from (a), what should be the signal waveform on reaching at the end (b)? I first not able to make properly then he given me more hint to think in the direction of capacitance changing case and skew etc.) Then i was able to explain perfectly.

- Then he given me the second case of driving several gates (suppose inverter) by using buffers. Like (i) 2 inverters driving with one clk signal & (ii) 4 inverters driving with same clk signal. What will be the difference between waveforms if Buffers are inserted on path (and how we know that which size buffer we have to use). I analyzed everything based on prev discussion and concluded perfect answer to him. That time he was impressed with me.

- Then he asked if i have any ques for him. Then i asked about what microchip does and what profile you are working on?!


### Round 2 (Virtual Interview) - 1 hr

- Whole interview went on deep down basics. Starting with my resume Heading in which Machine learning and Deep learning was mentioned. He asked me little bit make him to understand the basics and what algorithms i know but I'm not aware that much related to ML. It was just little in my MTech curriculum. He suggested me not to mention anything that i dont know from scratch.

- Then moved to STA. Starting with drawing internal Structure of Flip-flop. And explaining him how it function with proper signal and data waveform. This took very much time to explain him properly as i got panic as not able to remember exact connection of internal stucture.

- Then he entered in MOS basics. Draw characteristics graph showing regions also. And then reason for being in saturation of MOS. So I explained him by drawing proper MOS internal NMOS.

- Then i was asked to write current- voltage expression in saturation and linear region.
