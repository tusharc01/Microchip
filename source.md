## Source of preperation

*For Internship*

Digital VLSI -
  - Digital Logic Design or Digital Electronics
  - Verilog/VHDL Hardware Programming language
  - C programming needed atleast (later can learn C++ also)
  - Digital IC Design (For fundamentals theoretical knowledge necessary)
  - Static Timing Analysis (deep understanding req)
  - VLSI/ASIC Design Flow for IC design process (learning EDA tools will be a Plus for practical)
  - FPGA Prototyping (Theoretical atleast)

Advance Topics:
  - Computer Organisation and Architecture (for hardware role)
  - Deep down into Physical Design or DFT
  - ...  

*Best sources I've seen so far..*
